------DESCRIPTION---------
My project 'Vision' is an accessibility extension that allows a more wholesome experience for visually challenged users. 
It supports the following features - 

1. On loading the extension, a separate window allows for perusing the page's content. The window's font,
 contrast ratio and size follow ADA guidelines for accessibility. The font size can be increased and decreased 
 and the contrast and font can be changed randomly. 

 2. A voice narration is also enabled within the extension with real-time access to data. The narration can be 
 paused, played and stopped at will.

 This extension aims to make surfing the web more accessible for all.
